This is a fork of a fork of Crystal Ninja. The purpose of this project is to provide a way for Python to generate 
Crystal reports without the need for Crystal Reports software. This project is a work in progress. The goal is to be 
able to generate reports for use in web applications and email. A CrystalReportsNinja.exe has been compiled from 
DIR-twhitfield's fork of Crystal Ninja using NetFramework 4.5.1.

Crystal Runtime 13.0.20 is required to run CrystalReportsNinja.exe. The runtime installers are included in 
Crystal Reports Ninja/Deployment/
